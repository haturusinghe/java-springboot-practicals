## 1. Introduction to Java

### A. History and Overview
- **Origins:**  
  Java was developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s (now maintained by Oracle) with the philosophy “Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA).
- **Platform Independence:**  
  Java code is compiled to bytecode which runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it platform independent.
- **Core Components:**  
  - **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Contains the compiler (`javac`), runtime libraries, and tools.
  - **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** The runtime part of Java that runs Java bytecode.
  - **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** The engine that executes bytecode on your device.

### B. Why Java in Academia?
- **Object-Oriented:** Emphasizes OOP concepts which are crucial for understanding software design.
- **Strongly Typed & Robust:** Helps inculcate programming discipline.
- **Wide Industry Use:** A great stepping stone for future career opportunities.

2. **Installation:**  
   Follow the installer instructions for your operating system.
3. **JDK Setup:**  
   Make sure you have the latest JDK installed (Java 17 LTS or above is recommended). IntelliJ IDEA often auto-detects installed JDKs, but you can also download one from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/).

### B. Creating Your First Project in IntelliJ IDEA
1. **Launch IntelliJ IDEA.**
2. **Create New Project:**  
   - Click on **“New Project”**.
   - Choose **“Java”** from the list of project types.
   - Select the appropriate JDK.
3. **Project Structure:**  
   - Name your project (e.g., `JavaOOPGuide`).
   - Choose a location.
   - Click **“Finish”**.

### C. Running a Simple “Hello World”
1. **Create a new Java class:**  
   Right-click on the `src` folder > **New > Java Class** and name it `HelloWorld`.
2. **Enter the following code:**

   ```java
   public class HelloWorld {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           System.out.println("Hello, World!");
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**  
   Right-click on the file in the project explorer and select **“Run HelloWorld.main()”** or click the green arrow in the gutter.

### D. Exploring IntelliJ Features
- **Code Completion & Navigation:**

## 3. Java Fundamentals

Before diving into OOP, let’s quickly review some essential Java elements:

### A. Basic Syntax and Structure
- **Main Method:**  
  The entry point of any Java application.
  
  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Code goes here
  }
  ```

- **Comments:**
  - Single-line: `// This is a comment`
  - Multi-line: 
    ```java
    /* This is a 
       multi-line comment */
    ```

### B. Variables and Data Types
- **Primitive Data Types:** `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, `byte`, `short`, `long`, `float`
- **Reference Data Types:** Arrays, Classes, Interfaces, etc.

  ```java
  int age = 20;
  double price = 19.99;
  char letter = 'A';
  boolean isJavaFun = true;
  String message = "Hello, Java!";
  ```

### C. Control Structures
- **Conditional Statements:** `if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`

  ```java
  if (age > 18) {
      System.out.println("Adult");
  } else {
      System.out.println("Minor");
  }
  ```

- **Loops:** `for`, `while`, `do-while`

  ```java
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
  }
  ```

### D. Methods
- **Definition & Syntax:**

  ```java
  public int add(int a, int b) {
      return a + b;
  }
  ```

- **Method Overloading:** Same method name with different parameter lists.

## 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

Java is built on OOP principles. Understanding these concepts is key to designing scalable and maintainable code.

### 4.1 Classes and Objects

- **Class:**  
  A blueprint for objects that encapsulates data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

  ```java
  public class Car {
      // Attributes
      private String model;
      private int year;

      // Constructor
      public Car(String model, int year) {
          this.model = model;
          this.year = year;
      }

      // Method
      public void displayInfo() {
          System.out.println("Model: " + model + ", Year: " + year);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Object:**  
  An instance of a class.

  ```java
  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", 2020);
          myCar.displayInfo();
      }
  }
  ```

### 4.2 Encapsulation

- **Definition:**  
  Encapsulation is the practice of keeping fields within a class private, then providing access via public methods (getters and setters). It protects the integrity of the data.

- **Example:**

  ```java
  public class Student {
      // Private data members
      private String name;
      private int age;

      // Constructor
      public Student(String name, int age) {
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
      }

      // Getter and Setter methods
      public String getName() {
          return name;
      }

      public void setName(String name) {
          this.name = name;
      }

      public int getAge() {
          return age;
      }

      public void setAge(int age) {
          if (age > 0) {
              this.age = age;
          } else {
              System.out.println("Invalid age!");
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### 4.3 Inheritance

- **Definition:**  
  Inheritance allows one class (child or subclass) to inherit fields and methods from another (parent or superclass), promoting code reuse.

- **Syntax and Example:**

  ```java
  // Parent class
  public class Animal {
      public void eat() {
          System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
      }
  }

  // Child class
  public class Dog extends Animal {
      public void bark() {
          System.out.println("The dog barks.");
      }
  }

  public class TestInheritance {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Dog dog = new Dog();
          dog.eat();  // Inherited method
          dog.bark(); // Child-specific method
      }
  }
  ```

- **Key Points:**
  - Use the `extends` keyword.
  - The `super` keyword is used to refer to the parent class (often in constructors or to call overridden methods).

### 4.4 Polymorphism

- **Definition:**  
  Polymorphism means “many forms.” It allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. In Java, polymorphism comes in two forms:
  - **Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism:** Method Overloading.
  - **Runtime (Dynamic) Polymorphism:** Method Overriding.

- **Method Overloading Example (Compile-Time):**

  ```java
  public class Calculator {
      public int add(int a, int b) {
          return a + b;
      }

      public double add(double a, double b) {
          return a + b;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Method Overriding Example (Runtime):**

  ```java
  public class Animal {
      public void sound() {
          System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
      }
  }

  public class Cat extends Animal {
      @Override
      public void sound() {
          System.out.println("Cat meows");
      }
  }

  public class TestPolymorphism {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Animal myAnimal = new Cat();  // Upcasting
          myAnimal.sound();  // Calls the overridden method in Cat
      }
  }
  ```

### 4.5 Abstraction

- **Definition:**  
  Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. Java achieves abstraction through abstract classes and interfaces.

- **Abstract Classes:**

  ```java
  public abstract class Shape {
      // Abstract method (no body)
      public abstract double area();

      // Concrete method
      public void display() {
          System.out.println("Displaying shape.");
      }
  }

  public class Circle extends Shape {
      private double radius;

      public Circle(double radius) {
          this.radius = radius;
      }

      @Override
      public double area() {
          return Math.PI * radius * radius;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Interfaces:**

  ```java
  public interface Drawable {
      void draw();
  }

  public class Rectangle implements Drawable {
      private int width;
      private int height;

      public Rectangle(int width, int height) {
          this.width = width;
          this.height = height;
      }

      @Override
      public void draw() {
          System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
      }
  }
  ```

- **Differences Between Abstract Classes and Interfaces:**
  - **Abstract Classes:**
    - Can have both abstract and concrete methods.
    - A class can extend only one abstract class.
  - **Interfaces:**
    - All methods are implicitly public and abstract (until Java 8 introduced default and static methods).
    - A class can implement multiple interfaces.

## 5. Advanced OOP Topics

### A. Composition vs. Inheritance
- **Inheritance:**  
  “Is-a” relationship (e.g., a Dog **is a** Animal).
- **Composition:**  
  “Has-a” relationship (e.g., a Car **has a** Engine).  
  Composition is often preferred for flexibility and decoupling.

  ```java
  public class Engine {
      public void start() {
          System.out.println("Engine starting...");
      }
  }

  public class Car {
      // Composition: Car has an Engine.
      private Engine engine = new Engine();

      public void startCar() {
          engine.start();
      }
  }
  ```

### B. Static and Final Keywords
- **static:**  
  - Variables and methods belong to the class rather than any object instance.
  
    ```java
    public class MathUtils {
        public static int square(int x) {
            return x * x;
        }
    }
    // Usage: MathUtils.square(5);
    ```

- **final:**  
  - Used to declare constants (variables that cannot change) or prevent method overriding and class inheritance.
  
    ```java
    public final class Constants {
        public static final double PI = 3.14159;
    }
    ```

### C. Inner Classes
- **Definition:**  
  Classes defined within another class. Useful for logically grouping classes and increasing encapsulation.
  
  ```java
  public class Outer {
      private int outerValue = 10;

      public class Inner {
          public void display() {
              System.out.println("Outer value: " + outerValue);
          }
      }
  }
  ```

## 6. Best Practices, Debugging & Testing

### A. Best Coding Practices
- **Naming Conventions:**  
  Use meaningful names for classes (`PascalCase`), methods/variables (`camelCase`), and constants (`UPPER_CASE`).
- **Code Organization:**  
  Keep classes focused (Single Responsibility Principle). Use packages to group related classes.
- **Documentation:**  
  Write Javadoc comments for public APIs.  
  Example:
  ```java
  /**
   * Calculates the area of the circle.
   * @return the area based on the radius.
   */
  public double area() { ... }
  ```
- **Error Handling:**  
  Use exceptions wisely. Catch only exceptions you can handle and always clean up resources.

### B. Debugging in IntelliJ IDEA
- **Breakpoints:**  
  Click in the gutter next to a line number to set a breakpoint.
- **Step Over/Into:**  
  Use F8 (step over) and F7 (step into) during debugging.
- **Watches & Evaluate Expression:**  
  Monitor variable values and evaluate expressions on the fly.

### C. Testing with JUnit
- **JUnit Integration:**  
  IntelliJ supports JUnit tests out of the box. Create test classes and run them directly.
- **Simple Test Example:**

  ```java
  import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
  import org.junit.Test;

  public class CalculatorTest {
      @Test
      public void testAdd() {
          Calculator calc = new Calculator();
          int result = calc.add(2, 3);
          assertEquals(5, result);
      }
  }
  ```

## 7. Hands-On Examples & Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create a Simple Bank Account System
- **Class:** `BankAccount`
  - **Attributes:** account number, balance, account holder name.
  - **Methods:** deposit, withdraw, getBalance.
  
  ```java
  public class BankAccount {
      private String accountNumber;
      private double balance;

      public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double initialBalance) {
          this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
          this.balance = initialBalance;
      }

      public void deposit(double amount) {
          if (amount > 0) {
              balance += amount;
          }
      }

      public boolean withdraw(double amount) {
          if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
              balance -= amount;
              return true;
          }
          return false;
      }

      public double getBalance() {
          return balance;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Test Scenario:**  
  Instantiate a `BankAccount`, perform deposits and withdrawals, then display the final balance.

### Exercise 2: Build a Shape Hierarchy
- **Abstract Class:** `Shape` with an abstract method `area()`
- **Concrete Classes:** `Circle`, `Rectangle`
- **Demonstrate Polymorphism:**  
  Create an array of shapes and compute their areas in a loop.

### Exercise 3: Implement an Animal Hierarchy
- **Base Class:** `Animal` with method `makeSound()`
- **Subclasses:** `Dog`, `Cat` overriding `makeSound()`
- **Polymorphic Behavior:**  
  Store different animals in a list and call `makeSound()` on each.

Below is a detailed explanation covering several foundational topics in Java—from why it uses bytecode and how the Java tools (JDK, JRE, JVM) relate, to the different access modifiers and the five core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. At the end, you’ll find a complete code example that ties together all five OOP principles.

---

## 1. Java, Bytecode, and the JDK/JRE/JVM Relationship

### **Why Java Uses Bytecode**

**Explanation:**  
Java source code (written in `.java` files) is compiled into an intermediate, platform-independent form called **bytecode** (stored in `.class` files). The primary reasons for using bytecode are:

- **Platform Independence:**  
  Bytecode is not specific to any one operating system or hardware architecture. The same `.class` file can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This is often described as “Write Once, Run Anywhere.”

- **Security and Optimization:**  
  The JVM can verify and optimize bytecode before execution, adding a layer of security and performance enhancements.

**Example:**  
Imagine you write a simple program:
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
When you compile `HelloWorld.java` with the Java compiler (`javac`), it produces `HelloWorld.class` containing bytecode. This bytecode is then interpreted (or JIT-compiled) by the JVM on whatever device you run it.

---

### **The JDK, JRE, and JVM – What They Are and How They Interconnect**

- **JDK (Java Development Kit):**  
  This is the full kit for Java developers. It includes:
  - The **compiler** (`javac`) to convert source code into bytecode.
  - Development tools such as debuggers and documentation generators.
  - A complete **JRE** (described below) for running Java applications.

- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):**  
  This provides the libraries and environment needed to run Java programs. It includes:
  - The **JVM** (Java Virtual Machine) – the engine that executes bytecode.
  - Core libraries and supporting files.

- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):**  
  This is the runtime engine that reads and executes the bytecode. It is what makes Java platform-independent by acting as an abstraction layer between the bytecode and the underlying hardware and operating system.

**How They Work Together:**  
1. **Development:** You write Java source code.
2. **Compilation (JDK):** The JDK’s compiler (`javac`) translates your source code into bytecode.
3. **Execution (JRE & JVM):** The JRE provides the JVM, which loads and executes the bytecode.

---

## 2. Java Access Modifiers

Access modifiers in Java determine the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. Here’s a quick rundown:

- **`public`:**  
  Accessible from any other class in any package.
  
  ```java
  public class MyClass { ... }
  ```

- **`protected`:**  
  Accessible within its own package and by subclasses in other packages.
  
  ```java
  protected int protectedVar;
  ```

- **Default (no modifier):**  
  If no access modifier is specified, the member is accessible only within its own package (also known as package-private).
  
  ```java
  int packagePrivateVar;
  ```

- **`private`:**  
  Accessible only within the class where it is declared.
  
  ```java
  private String secret;
  ```

Using access modifiers is a key part of **encapsulation**, one of the core OOP concepts, as they help protect the internal state of an object from unintended interference.

## 3. The 5 OOP Concepts Explained (Viva-Style)

Imagine you’re in a college viva, and you’re asked to explain the core OOP principles. Here’s how you might answer:

1. **Classes and Objects:**
   - **Class:** Think of a class as a blueprint or template. For example, a `Car` class defines what a car is: its properties (like model, color) and its behaviors (like drive, brake).
   - **Object:** An object is an instance of a class. Using the `Car` blueprint, you can create many car objects (e.g., a red Toyota, a blue Honda).

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - This is the concept of bundling the data (fields) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object’s components—this is done using access modifiers (private, public, etc.).  
   - **Analogy:** It’s like a capsule or a pill that hides its contents from the outside world. You interact with it only through well-defined methods.

3. **Inheritance:**
   - Inheritance allows one class to inherit fields and methods from another class. It promotes code reusability.  
   - **Analogy:** Consider a `Vehicle` class. A `Car` or `Motorcycle` is a type of vehicle. Both inherit common features (like having wheels) from the `Vehicle` class, but they may also have specific features.

4. **Polymorphism:**
   - Polymorphism means “many forms.” It allows methods to do different things based on the object that is calling them. This is achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).  
   - **Analogy:** Think of a universal remote control that can operate a TV, DVD player, or air conditioner. Although the interface is the same, the actual behavior changes depending on the device.

5. **Abstraction:**
   - Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. In Java, abstraction is implemented using abstract classes and interfaces.  
   - **Analogy:** When you drive a car, you don’t need to understand the complex workings of the engine. You only interact with the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shifter. The internal workings are hidden (abstracted away).

## 4. A Comprehensive Code Example Tying Together All 5 OOP Concepts

Below is a complete Java example that demonstrates:

- **Classes and Objects:** We create classes like `Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat` and instantiate objects.
- **Encapsulation:** Private fields with public getters.
- **Inheritance:** `Dog` and `Cat` extend the abstract `Animal` class.
- **Polymorphism:** Overriding the `makeSound()` method in subclasses.
- **Abstraction:** The `Animal` class is declared abstract and defines an abstract method that must be implemented by its subclasses.

```java
// Abstract class demonstrating Abstraction
abstract class Animal {
    // Encapsulation: private field with a public getter
    private String name;

    // Constructor to initialize the encapsulated field
    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Public getter for name (accessing private data)
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses (Abstraction)
    public abstract void makeSound();

    // A concrete method that is inherited by all subclasses
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println(name + " is sleeping.");
    }
}

// Inheritance: Dog class extends Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Constructor that passes the name to the Animal class constructor
    public Dog(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    // Polymorphism: Overriding makeSound() for Dog's specific behavior
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println(getName() + " barks: Woof Woof!");
    }
}

// Inheritance: Cat class extends Animal
class Cat extends Animal {
    public Cat(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    // Polymorphism: Overriding makeSound() for Cat's specific behavior
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println(getName() + " meows: Meow Meow!");
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate Classes & Objects, and Polymorphism
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating objects (Instances of Dog and Cat) – Classes and Objects
        Animal myDog = new Dog("Buddy");
        Animal myCat = new Cat("Whiskers");

        // Polymorphism in action: even though the type is Animal,
        // the overridden makeSound() of the actual object is called.
        myDog.makeSound();  // Outputs: Buddy barks: Woof Woof!
        myCat.makeSound();  // Outputs: Whiskers meows: Meow Meow!

        // Using the inherited concrete method from Animal
        myDog.sleep();      // Outputs: Buddy is sleeping.
        myCat.sleep();      // Outputs: Whiskers is sleeping.
    }
}
```

### **Explanation of the Code Example:**

- **Classes and Objects:**  
  We have defined three classes: an abstract class `Animal`, and two concrete classes `Dog` and `Cat` that extend `Animal`. In the `Main` class, we create instances (objects) of `Dog` and `Cat`.

- **Encapsulation:**  
  The field `name` in `Animal` is declared `private`, so it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. A public getter method (`getName()`) is provided to access this value safely.

- **Inheritance:**  
  Both `Dog` and `Cat` inherit from the `Animal` class. This means they automatically have access to the `sleep()` method and the `name` field (via the getter).

- **Polymorphism:**  
  The method `makeSound()` is declared as abstract in `Animal` and is overridden in both `Dog` and `Cat`. When we call `makeSound()` on an `Animal` reference, the JVM determines at runtime which implementation to use based on the actual object type.

- **Abstraction:**  
  The abstract class `Animal` hides the details of what sound an animal makes. It provides a general contract (via the abstract method `makeSound()`) that all subclasses must follow, without revealing how each subclass implements it.

This explanation and code example should give you (or your audience) a clear picture of why Java is designed the way it is, how its runtime components work together, and how the fundamental OOP principles come together to create robust, maintainable code.

### **1. Why Java Uses Bytecode & JDK vs JRE vs JVM**
**Why Bytecode?**  
Java compiles source code (`.java`) into **bytecode** (`.class`), which is platform-independent. The JVM (not your OS) runs this bytecode, enabling the "write once, run anywhere" magic.  
**Example**:  
Imagine you write a Java program on Windows. The `.class` file (bytecode) can run on a Mac or Linux machine *without recompiling*, as long as a JVM exists for that OS.

**JDK, JRE, JVM Explained**  
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**:  
  The *toolbox* for developers. It includes the compiler (`javac`), debugger, and JRE.  
  *You need JDK to **write** Java code.*  
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**:  
  The *playback system* for end-users. It includes the JVM + libraries to **run** Java programs.  
  *No JDK? No problem. Users only need JRE to **run** your code.*  
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**:  
  The *interpreter* that executes bytecode line-by-line. It’s part of the JRE.  

**Interconnection**:  
`JDK → (includes) → JRE → (includes) → JVM`  
**Analogy**:  
- JDK = **Kitchen** (tools to cook/compile food/code).  
- JRE = **Dining Room** (space to eat/run the food).  
- JVM = **Waiter** (serves the food/bytecode to your plate/OS).

### **2. Access Modifiers**  
Control **visibility** of classes, methods, and variables.  

| Modifier   | Visibility                                  | Example                          |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `public`   | Everywhere (any class/package)             | `public int score;`              |
| `private`  | Only within the same class                 | `private String password;`       |
| `protected`| Same package + subclasses (even in diff pkgs)| `protected void calculate() {…}` |
| *default*  | Same package only (no keyword)             | `int count;`                     |

**Example**:  
```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // Hidden from outsiders
    
    public double getBalance() { // Public access method
        return balance;
    }
}
```

### **3. OOP Concepts Explained Like a College Student**  
**1. Encapsulation**  
*"Keep your secrets, dude."*  
- Hide data (make fields `private`) and expose only what’s needed (via `public` methods).  
- Example: Your Instagram DMs are private—you decide who sees them via settings (getters/setters).

**2. Inheritance**  
*"Like getting your dad’s old car, but you upgrade the stereo."*  
- Reuse code by creating a child class that inherits fields/methods from a parent.  
- Example: `class Tesla extends Car { … }` → Tesla gets all Car features + can add self-driving.

**3. Polymorphism**  
*"Same name, different swag."*  
- One name, many forms. Override methods in subclasses or overload methods.  
- Example: Your dog `barks()`, but your friend’s dog `barks()` *louder*. Same method, different behavior.

**4. Abstraction**  
*"Just give me the highlights, not the lecture."*  
- Hide complex details. Use abstract classes/interfaces to define *what* to do, not *how*.  
- Example: You know a `Phone` can `call()`, but you don’t care how the signal works.

**5. Composition**  
*"Building a PC with parts."*  
- Create objects inside other objects (has-a relationship). More flexible than inheritance.  
- Example: A `Car` *has* an `Engine`, `Wheels`, not *is* an `Engine`.

### **4. Code Example: All 5 OOP Concepts**  
```java
// 1. ABSTRACTION (Abstract class)
abstract class Animal {
    // 2. ENCAPSULATION (private field)
    private String name;

    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Abstract method (what to do, not how)
    public abstract void makeSound();

    // 3. POLYMORPHISM (method overriding)
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
    }

    // Getter for encapsulation
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

// 4. INHERITANCE (subclass)
class Dog extends Animal {
    // 5. COMPOSITION (has-a relationship)
    private Toy toy;

    public Dog(String name, Toy toy) {
        super(name);
        this.toy = toy;
    }

    // Polymorphism: Overriding makeSound()
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println(getName() + " says Woof!");
    }

    // New method using composition
    public void play() {
        System.out.println(getName() + " plays with " + toy.getToyName());
    }
}

// Composition helper class
class Toy {
    private String toyName;

    public Toy(String toyName) {
        this.toyName = toyName;
    }

    public String getToyName() {
        return toyName;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Toy ball = new Toy("Tennis Ball"); 
        Dog myDog = new Dog("Buddy", ball);
        
        myDog.makeSound(); // Polymorphism: Dog's version
        myDog.eat();      // Inherited from Animal
        myDog.play();      // Uses composition (Toy)
    }
}
```

**Output**:  
```
Buddy says Woof!  
Buddy is eating.  
Buddy plays with Tennis Ball  
```

**Explanation**:  
- **Abstraction**: `Animal` defines `makeSound()` without implementation.  
- **Encapsulation**: `name` is private, accessed via `getName()`.  
- **Inheritance**: `Dog` extends `Animal`.  
- **Polymorphism**: Overridden `makeSound()`.  
- **Composition**: `Dog` has a `Toy`.  

This code ties all 5 concepts into a relatable example (dogs, toys, sounds) that’s easy to grasp!
